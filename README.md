## Technology

- AXIOS
- React JS
- RUBY ON RAILS

## Planning

Days in advance of capstone project I went through the requirements, did some research
deciding what API to use for my capstone project.

- Read requirements
- Follow suggested schedule
- Start coding on the back end with Rails
- Start coding on the front end with React

## Development Process

 I focused on setting up my back end API. Next I moved to figure out how to understand the components in React.
 After struggling to grasp breaking up my code I decided at the end of the day 1 I should focus on MVP.

- Set up and deploy both repos on github and heroku
- Set up API
- Develop React components
- Deploy working code
- Final debbugging
- Styling
- Final deploy

## How It Works

The front end makes axios requests to the API. The API is a RESTful API built on
Rails. It queries the database and returns a JSON. JavaScript parses the JSON
and renders pieces of it on the page using React. React is stylized using
CSS.

## Problems

Using React to develop a full stack web app I encoutered a lot of unexpected issues. I sill did not get to the issue cue as much as I should of. Most of my problems I ran into, I came up with the solution while writing the issue in some instances.
